SIH – Smart Healthcare Platform 🏥
<!-- PROBLEM STATEMENT -->
Problem Statement

Access to healthcare services is often delayed due to lack of real-time medical assistance, ambulance unavailability, and difficulties in medicine accessibility.
The challenge is to build a smart web-based healthcare platform that connects patients, donors, and medical services efficiently.

This platform should allow people to:

Find nearby ambulances in emergencies.

Access medicine delivery at home.

Search medicines using a medicine dictionary.

Support organ donation & recipient matching.

Provide a support system for patient/NGO needs.
